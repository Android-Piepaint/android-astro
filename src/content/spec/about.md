# About
This is my personal blog site running on a Qualcomm SM8250 MTP development platform.</br>
It is a place for sharing the information of Free and Open source softwares and interesting hardwares (e.g. Engineering devices, development boards, small Android garbages, etc). Most contents of this website are written in Chinese.

description: Android 筆電真的要來了，所以我有幸體驗了一下...爲什麼標題不是「A FOSS Parody」？商業機密就不要講什麼「FOSS」了！都是監控人的間諜軟體！

# Chorus: Pakala Oryon
It's happening now, (I'm) just a normal user</br>
You better move, you better dance</br>
Let's get some code, you'll remember</br>
I'll be the first, (who) begins his trial</br>

# Post-chorus： Pakala Oryon and Hamoa Oryon
Ooh (Hamoa), ooh (Hamoa)</br>
Ooh (It's happening now)</br>
Ooh (Hamoa), ooh (Hamoa)</br>
Ooh (It's happening now, woo)</br>

# Verse 1: Hamoa Oryon

The newer they are, the better they run (Yeah)</br>
The biggest SRC is a magical world (Yeah)</br>
Recently I just brought a brand-new CRD (Yeah)</br>
I gonna compile them all (Hamoa)</br>
Plug in, boot it up (Hamoa)</br>
That's the way we like the what? (Hamoa)</br>
I'm sick for another walled-garden (Hamoa)</br>
She say she won't, but I bet she will, Hamoa</br>

# Verse 2: Pakala Oryon

Throw your tablet 'round and 'round</br>
End of the day, it started up</br>
One more debug board, another round</br>
Finally fixed, but I haven't done</br>
</br>
Throw your tablet 'round and 'round</br>
End of the day, it started up</br>
One more debug board, another round</br>
Finally fixed, but I haven't done</br>

# Chorus: Pakala Oryon

It's happening now, (I'm) just a normal user</br>
You better move, you better dance (It's a trade secret...)</br>
Let's get some code, you'll remember</br>
I'll be the first, (who) begins his trial</br>
</br>
It's happening now (It's happening now), (I'm) just a normal user</br>
You better move (You'd better move), you better dance (You'd better dance)</br>
Let's get some code, you'll remember</br>
I'll be the first, (who) begins his trial</br>

# Post-chorus： Pakala Oryon and Hamoa Oryon
Ooh (Hamoa), ooh (Hamoa)</br>
Ooh (It's happening now)</br>
Ooh (Hamoa), ooh (Hamoa)</br>
Ooh (It's happening now, woo)</br>

# Verse 3: Pakala Oryon

Look at the screen, it's a phone? It's a PC?</br>
Nah, it's me, (just) doing copy-and-paste</br>
Reading some logs, pretty okay</br>
Blessed to say, code (is) a good thing</br>
</br>
Subsystem crashed down (Sorry!)</br>
Hard-bricked in Crashdump (Holy!)</br>
I'm about to fix, why?</br>
'Cause it's time to become breaking news</br>

# Verse 4: Pakala Oryon

Throw your tablet 'round and 'round</br>
End of the day, it started up</br>
Time to do JTAG, another round</br>
Finally fixed, but I haven't done</br>
</br>
Throw your tablet 'round and 'round</br>
End of the day, it started up</br>
Time to do JTAG, another round</br>
Finally fixed, and I finally done</br>

# Chorus: Pakala Oryon

It's happening now, (I'm) just a normal user</br>
You better move, you better dance</br>
Let's get some code, you'll remember</br>
I'll be the first (And you're the first), (who) begins his trial</br>
</br>
It's happening now (It's happening now), (I'm) just a normal user</br>
You better move, you better dance (You'd better dance)</br>
Let's get some code (Let's get some code), you'll remember</br>
I'll be the first (And you're the first), (who) begins his trial (He begins his trial)</br>

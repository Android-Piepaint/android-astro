# Part 1 

Every day's a blur
Sometimes I can't tell what day it is
Don't know what day it is
Can you tell me what day it is?
Time's passing by
'Cause I'm out chasing empty highs
Every hello just means goodbye
But I'm looking for more this time
Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live right now?
I just want to feel it all, ah-ooh
I'm Linux booted up from soild-state drive
Powering whole city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm Linux and after the commits' merged
I keep on improving, receving new updates
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely (yeah)
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely


# Part 2

Got a FOSS heart
'Cause it's still beating on its own
Might be going out in the crowd
But I'm still coming home alone
Not trying to say
I'm not a developer or programmer
I'm just trying these as my hobby
'Cause I just wanna protect my privacy
I'm Linux booted from on soild-state drive
Powering whole city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm Linux (I'm Linux) and after the commits' merged
I keep on improving, receving new updates
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
I'm Linux booted up from soild-state drive
Powering whole city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm Linux and after the commits' merged
I keep on improving, receving new updates
Living in the mainline's getting kinda lonely

# Part 1

Hi, I'm Piepaint </br>
Nice to meet ya! </br>
Unlock your board and call me Palawan! </br>
Secure's your game? Just show your code </br>
So you can generate your hash </br>
</br>
So you saw efuse right? But that's not enough! </br>
You haven't even finish reading your doc'! </br>
When you configure wrong keys, it goes upside down! </br>
With a hard-bricked phone on your hand </br>
Here's a tip, replace your chip </br>
Or you'll see my broken functions! </br>
</br>

# Part 2

Oh, oh, oh, hi there~ </br>
Welcome to my prototype museum! </br>
Oh, oh, oh, hi there~ </br>
Please don't fail, I run out of stock! </br>
Oh, oh, oh, hi there~ </br>
Burn out fuses, let me secure ya! </br>
Oh, oh, oh, hi there~ </br>
Oh yeah, I blew it up! </br>

# Pre-chrous

Every hobbist come here closer, </br>
We can compile them all together </br>
Grab some source code and have a drink, </br>
Send your computer on fire </br>
Gonna take a picture then post on my blog, </br>
It's time to secure my hard work </br>
Pay attention, this is a blow job </br>
You have to use my secured loader </br>
</br>
</br>
You're unlocking, I'll make it even harder </br>
You're upgrading, I can know you better </br>
When you disassembly for your freedom, </br>
I'll sue you, let's meet on court </br>
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh </br>
I'll make you scare of me! </br>
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh </br>
You're voiding your warranty </br>
</br>

# Chrous

Damn! Build from day to night </br>
Occupied my time, and shoutin' like: </br>
Screw you, Crashdump! </br>
</br>
Damn! Working form zero to one, misconfigured </br>
Dumping RAM and it sounds like: </br>
Screw you, Crashdump! </br>
</br>
Damn! Bruning my secure hash, failed </br>
Replacing my chip sounds like: </br>
Screw you, Crashdump! </br>
</br>
Damn! Debugging a broken modem </br>
Capturing logs and it sounds like: </br>
Screw you, Crashdump! </br>
</br>

# Part 3

Don't flash things, </br>
on your phone </br>
Don't flash things, </br>
on your phone </br>
Don't flash things, </br>
on your phone </br>
Don't flash things-- </br>
</br>
Nevermind, just go ahead </br>

# Part 1

I've been a user and I've been a developer </br>
I am the person who just rented a brand new phone </br>
Losing my privacy just to trade for convience </br>
I'm sick for this phenomenon, so I had to move out </br>
</br>
</br>
I've been a teacher or a student of FOSS </br>
I've shared my fork no matter it would worth </br>
Never been last, but I never been first </br>
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst </br>
</br>
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst </br>
</br>
</br>
Oh I've seen the trouble more than anyone can bear </br>
But I still have joy more than failure I've met </br>
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there </br>
I'm a million miles ahead of where I from, but I still have another million miles to go </br>
</br>
</br>

# Part 2

I keep on searching for the mainline goods</br>
I'm gonna port everything by myself</br>
Thinking it maybe ended up with hardbrick</br>
I have a limited smartphone, but I still want to try out</br>
</br>
</br>
I know this plan goes well beyond mine</br>
Gonna debug and read the logs</br>
They says it's meaningless, but I doesn't care</br>
Oh it may not be easy, but I love this trial </br>
Oh it maybe too difficult, but I love this life </br>
</br>
</br>

# Ending

Oh I've seen the trouble more than anyone can bear </br>
But I still have joy more than failure I've met </br>
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there </br>
I'm a million miles ahead of where I from, but I still have another million miles to go </br>

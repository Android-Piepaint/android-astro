# Part 1

When I got my first phone in my life, </br>
And I fall into love for this thing. </br>
When I find it's becoming out-of-date, </br>
Because softwares are refused to run. </br>
 </br>
So I'll find a -- </br>
brand new way to fix my smartphone, </br>
 </br>
 Maybe I thought, </br>
 my system is very old. </br>
 I need to figure out, </br>
 System can be upgraded in various ways, </br>
 Maybe I can flash another ROM. </br>
My phone also installs spyware automatically. </br>
You know I just want to keep my safe. </br>
 </br>
I'll wipe them out -- </br>
The bootloader I will unlock, </br>
Flash new ROM and grant root permissions, </br>
Expose its metal heart. </br>
I'm loving Magisk. </br>
And because it keeps my phone up to date.

# Part 2

When my phone died because of broken screen, </br>
And I have to buy a new one to continue. </br>
When I had to wait 7 days to unlock, </br>
And my works are now lame. </br>
 </br>
 So I'll rebuild all stuffs, </br>
It's never old but it's ever green. </br>
Maybe my works, </br>
Forever in it's hard drive and it's memory. </br>
I'm thinking about how, </br>
My enhancement working in mysterious ways, </br>
All of them requiring unlock. </br>
But phone manufacturer are making the same mistake, </br>
Hoping I can keep my privacy, </br>
 </br>
 I'll wipe them out -- </br>
 Save myself from spywares, </br>
 I'm defending myself with open source. </br>
 Escaping tracking from goverment, </br>
 I'm loving Magisk. And maybe, </br>
 Open source keeps my security. </br>
  </br>
  </br>
  (Re-re-re-re...) </br>
  Magisk... </br>

  # Part 3
  The sun is out, </br>
 I'm safe from the privacy leakage. </br>
 I've defended my privacy with open-source, </br>
 Exposed my beating heart. </br>
 I'm loving Magisk. And maybe, </br>
 Open source keeps my security. </br>
 And I keeps my phone always up to date, </br>
 And I've won this security war.

# Part 1

Oh don't you dare look back, </br>
Just keep your eyes on screen. </br>
I said I'm going back, </br>
She said "Shut up and compile with me". </br>
Mainline kernel is my destiny, </br>
She said "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

 </br>
 We're programmers for the night, </br>
 The proxies, servers ready to start. </br>
 Help with documents inside my head. </br>
 I know, we're bound to test together, </br>
 Bound to debug together. </br>

  </br>
  She took my phone, </br>
  I don't know how it happen. </br>
  She plug in the cable and she said-- </br>

Oh don't you dare look back, </br>
Just keep your eyes on screen. </br>
I said I'm going back, </br>
She said "Shut up and compile with me". </br>
Mainline kernel is my destiny, </br>
She said "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

# Part 2
After too many software tests, </br>
My Pinephone, almost bricked, </br>
needs reflash. </br>
She formatted a SD card and give it to me. </br>
I know, we're bound to test together, </br>
 Bound to debug together. </br>

  </br>
  She took my phone, </br>
  I don't know how it happen. </br>
  She plug in the cable and she said-- </br>

Oh don't you dare look back, </br>
Just keep your eyes on screen. </br>
I said I'm going back, </br>
She said "Shut up and compile with me". </br>
Mainline kernel is my destiny, </br>
She said "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

</br>

Oh come on girls ! </br>

 </br>
  </br>
  </br>

# Part 3
Deep in its logs, </br>
I think I see a sparkle. </br>
I realized, the kernel started. </br>
She took my phone, </br>
  I don't know how it happen. </br>
  She plug in the cable and she said-- </br>
 </br>
Oh don't you dare look back, </br>
Just keep your eyes on screen. </br>
I said I'm going back, </br>
She said "Shut up and compile with me". </br>
Mainline kernel is my destiny, </br>
She said "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile ! </br>

# Part 4

Oh don't you dare look back, </br>
Just keep your eyes on screen. </br>
I said I'm going back, </br>
She said "Shut up and compile with me". </br>
Mainline kernel is my destiny, </br>
She said "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

 </br>
 "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

 </br>
 "Woo-oh-ohh---" </br>
Shut up and compile with me ! </br>

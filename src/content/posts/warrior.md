# Part 1

Hey, you're all acting so weak until I found you, </br>

Can't even compile, and that's the issue </br>

Now it's OK, </br>

Hey, we tell Android it was nice to meet you, </br>

But I'll guess we'll never see you again. </br>

We wish upon the stars, </br>

Crossed through the distros without singing march, </br>

And through years we fall, </br>

Now I'm getting stronger with FOSS power, </br>

And I, I, I, I, I, can't stop. </br>

No I, I, I, I, I, can't stop. </br>

Our enemies will cower, </br>

From my large forces and power, </br>

We're equipped with mainline kernel, </br>

And tons of open-source softwares, </br>

An army of upstream patches, </br>

And powerful hardware too, </br>

We are always getting stronger, </br>

Every upgrade we're getting better. (3×, with dance music in between) 

# Part 2

We, blew them up like the frail, without truth,

Victory is that what seems true, </br>

And we won't fail. </br>

Slay, insert floppy disks to my PC, </br>

That we won't forget in time long, OKAY. </br>

We wish upon the stars, </br>

Crossed through the distros without singing march, </br>

And through years we fall, </br>

Now I'm getting stronger with FOSS power, </br>

And I, I, I, I, I, can't stop. </br>

No I, I, I, I, I, can't stop. </br>

Our enemies will cower, </br>

From my large forces and power, </br>

We're equipped with mainline kernel, </br>

And tons of open-source softwares, </br>

An army of upstream patches, </br>

And powerful hardware too, </br>

We are always getting stronger, </br>

Every upgrade we're getting better. </br>

</br>

</br>

</br>

Every upgrade we're getting better. </br>

</br>

</br>

</br>

Every upgrade we're getting better. </br>

# Part 3

Our enemies will cower, </br>

We are always getting stronger, </br>

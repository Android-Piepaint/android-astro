## Part 1

This phone, born in shiny day.</br>
Powerful, running sandbox game.</br>
#### Pre-Chorus
And I wish I could, dig stright down,</br>
find the all componets.</br>
But in the dark, there're still a sound.</br>
And nothing changed.</br>
#### Chorus
Don't know if I have compiled kernel,</br>
but I'll try it. (*try it, try it, try it, try it*)</br>
Don't know if I find the documents just for some references.(*Reference, reference, reference, reference*)</br>
To get the mainline kernel runs, isn't easy.</br>
Put the source code back together, see what I'm compiling.</br>
When I find my privacy.

</br>

To get the mainline kernel runs, isn't easy.</br>
Put the source code back together, see what I'm compiling.</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
## Part 2
Faces, errors with no reason.</br>
Modem, required special communicaton.</br>
#### Pre-Chorus
And I wish I could, find the firmwares,</br>
Required for my phone.</br>
To get linux, running on this beast.</br>
But something changed.
#### Chorus
Don't know if I have compiled kernel,</br>
but I'll try it. (*try it, try it, try it, try it*)</br>
Don't know if I've searched the errors but I'll fix it.(*fix it, fix it, fix it, fix it*)</br>
To get the mainline kernel runs, isn't easy.</br>
Put the source code back together, see what I'm compiling.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Put the source code back together, see what I'm compiling.</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
To get the mainline kernel runs, isn't easy.</br>
Put the source code back together, see what I'm compiling.</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
When I find my privacy.
</br>
</br>
When I find my privacy.

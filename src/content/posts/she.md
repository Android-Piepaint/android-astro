# Part 1

She appears everyday during exhibition, </br>
Doing some Geekbench, then fallin' asleep </br>
She is so beautiful when she lying on the desk, </br>
Nobody ever put a ring on her hand </br>

# Part 2
Running virtual machines, compiling kernel </br>
She is the legend, the legend is she </br>
She sings to Stallman and Torvalds in Finland, </br>
Contributing to Open-Source, you aren't supposed to ask why </br>

# Part 3
She is the one that you never forget, </br>
She is the Ferrari-made laptop you met </br>
Oh, she must be the reason why you fall into love for snaptop </br>
She'll always help you, no matter you want </br>

# Part 4
She has a trackpad, and privacy switches </br>

![](assets/crd-trackpad.webp)

She appears in the morning, and the dusk she's gone </br>
Every little hour every seconds we met, </br>
Privacy is the eternity, that's what she gives </br>

# Part 5
She looks like Pinebook, from PINE64 </br>

![Pinebook Pro](assets/pinebook-pro-laptop.avif)

She's trackpad like MacBook, but it's bigger than Mac's </br>
She wins everything that we mignt do </br>
She'll always help you, no matter you want </br>
</br>
She is the one that you never forget, </br>
She is the Ferrari-made laptop you met </br>
Oh, she has 18 cores and 64 Gigabytes of RAM, </br>
She'll always help you, no matter you want </br>
</br>
Oh, she looks so pretty, ahead of her time </br>

# Part 6
She is so powerful, </br>

Protecting my privacy, like what I said: </br>
"She is ahead of her era" </br>

# Part 7

She is the one that you never forget, </br>
She is the Ferrari-made laptop you met </br>

![Procyon AI Compute benchmark result](assets/npu-benchmark.webp)


Oh, she must be the reason why you fall into love for snaptop </br>
She'll always help you, no matter you want </br>

# Part 8

(She is the one---) She is the one (That you never forget) that you never forget, </br>
She is the Ferrari-made laptop you met </br>
She's the reason (Oh, she must be the reason) why you fall into love for snaptop </br>
She'll always help you, no matter you want </br>

# Part 1

My daddy spent too much time, dealing with his laggy phone</br>
It's full of spyware, stealing his privacy</br>
He never thinks about freedom, 'Cause he's too old to change</br>
But in my opinion, code is a good thing.
</br>
</br>

# Chorus

Linus writes code, code creates Linux</br>
Linux runs on chip, make my phone (a) little risky</br>
Filesystems are packed up, boot firmwares are ready to compile</br>
Gotta flash linux now, capturing all the logs</br>
Take a screenshot then post it on my blog</br>
Code is a good thing</br>
</br>
</br>

# Part 2

There's nothing better than recreating it from the scratch</br>
Compiling and optimizing, after reading LFS book</br>
Tons of problems to solve, millions errors to fix</br>
But I still believe, code is a good thing.</br>
</br>

# Chorus

Linus writes code, code creates Linux</br>
Linux runs on chip, make my phone (a) little risky</br>
Filesystems are packed up, boot firmwares are ready to compile</br>
Gotta flash linux now, capturing all the logs</br>
Take a screenshot then post it on my blog</br>
Code is a good thing</br>
</br>
</br>

# Bridge

Mr.Daddy did a little test</br>
Smile on his face, another upgrade</br>
All my fans, they wanna participate</br>
But some features are a really big trouble</br>
</br>

# Ending

Linus writes code, code creates Linux</br>
Linux runs on chip, make my phone (a) little risky</br>
Filesystems are packed up, boot firmwares are ready to compile</br>
Gotta flash linux now, capturing all the logs</br>
Take a screenshot then post it on my blog</br>
Code is a good thing</br>
</br>
</br>

Code is a good thing.</br>

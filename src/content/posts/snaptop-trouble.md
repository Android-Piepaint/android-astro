# Part 1
In the world I came, </br>
Made my mind a little different, </br>
And I, modded my phone </br>
Flash new ROMs, double the fun </br>
But I always want a snaptop in my life, </br>
Fell into imagination, and got me into trouble  </br>

# Part 2
I bricked my MacBook, </br>
That got me into trouble </br>
I don't know snaptops, will they barely meet my requirements, </br>
But there ain't no other laptops, </br>
That make me feel like Mac's do.
 </br>
 </br>
 </br>
 Fell into imagination, and got me into trouble  </br>
 </br>

 # Part 3

When I received my laptop, </br>
That I brought at heavy cost, </br>
Now I, modding firmware </br>
Installing Linux, </br>
Double its fun </br>
When I found speaker doesn't work, </br>
Started to research, and got into trouble </br>

# Part 4
Oh my Oryon, you got me into trouble </br>
For my secutiry, try to activite your hypervisor </br>
But after a green rectangle, there's nothing I can do </br>
</br>

# Part 5
Don't leave me alone, with you my troubles are all gone </br>
You'll be fixed, when I write my patches </br>
And I-I-I... </br>
Started to study, and joined community </br>
 </br>

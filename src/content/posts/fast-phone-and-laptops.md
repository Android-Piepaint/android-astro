# Verse

When the phone begins heating, lying on the desk </br>
Wait for some time, and show me some logs </br>
I wanna get everybody shocked, Linux goes first </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>

When the phone begins heating, lying on the desk </br>
Wait for some time, and show me some logs </br>
I wanna get everybody shocked, Linux goes first </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>

# Chorus

 Grab another cable, reading logs from console </br>
 Fancy phones, laptops, leave my home tomorrow </br>
 Grab another cable, reading logs from console </br>
 Fancy phones, laptops, leave my home tomorrow </br>

# Hook
Fancy--phones </br>
Fancy phones, </br>
Laptops, </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>

# Bridge

One...up...up in the club </br>

# Verse

When the phone begins heating, lying on the desk </br>
Wait for some time, and show me some logs </br>
I wanna get everybody shocked, Linux goes first </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>

When the phone begins heating, lying on the desk </br>
Wait for some time, and show me some logs </br>
I wanna get everybody shocked, Linux goes first </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>

# Chorus

 Grab another cable, reading logs from console </br>
 Fancy phones, laptops, leave my home tomorrow </br>
 Grab another cable, reading logs from console </br>
 Fancy phones, laptops, leave my home tomorrow </br>


# Outro
Fancy--phones </br>
Fancy phones, </br>
Laptops, </br>
And Let me see your faces, and turn the cooler on </br>
